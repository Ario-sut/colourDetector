# Color Detection in Images

This Python script allows you to detect the color of a pixel in an image and display its corresponding color name and RGB values. It utilizes OpenCV and pandas libraries to read the image, handle mouse events, and retrieve color information from a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`) library
- pandas library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script `color_detection.py` directly.

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

   cv2
   ```shell
   pip install opencv-python
   
   pandas
   ```shell
   pip install pandas
